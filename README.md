## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## Y-AXIS BASE :
The base of the printer that supports the rest of the components, Y-axis typically refers to the vertical movement of the print head or the printing platform.
## Z-AXIS FRAME :
Z-axis typically represents the vertical movement of the print head or the printing platform. While the Y-axis is associated with the rotation around the vertical axis 
## SMOOTH RODS :
smooth rods play a crucial role in providing stability and smooth movement for various components of the printer.
## MOTORS :
They play a critical role in driving the movement of various components and enabling the printing process.
## EXTRUDER SUPPORTER :
The support structure that holds the extruder assembly
## THREADED ROD :
They can vary depending on the specific design and implementation. 
## Y-AXIS FRAME :
It plays a crucial role in providing stability and support for the Y-axis movement. 
## MOTOR WITH GEAR:
They can translate the rotational motion of the motor into the desired movement of various components.
## MOTOR-WITH-PULLEY :
Motor-with-pulley assembly serves an essential role in driving the movement of the print bed or the print head along the Y-axis.
## GEARS :
Gears can play various roles depending on the specific design and implementation.
## PLATE :
Plate serves as a fundamental component that provides a stable and level surface for the printing process. 
## EXTRUDER :
In the 3D printing process by depositing the filament material onto the print bed or previously printed layers.
## FILAMENT:
The filament is a thermoplastic material that is fed into the 3D printer to create objects layer by layer.
